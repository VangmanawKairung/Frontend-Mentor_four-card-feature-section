### What I learned

In completing the "Four card feature section" challenge, I learned a lot about working with React.js and Sass.

I rearranged the information by organizing the data into component forms, which made the code more modular.

[card-detail](src/components/card-detail.js)

I also realized that Sass cannot be used directly without first installing the necessary package.

Additionally, I experimented with the CSS property `align-self`, which I had never used before, and it helped me align elements in a way that wasnâ€™t possible with the usual methods.

This challenge was a great opportunity to improve my React and CSS skills.

### Continued development

I'm thinking about adding an active state to the card components. When a user clicks on a card, it will highlight the selected card to provide visual feedback. Additionally, I plan to implement a redirect feature that will take users to the main site of each card for more detailed information. This will enhance the interactivity and user experience of the component.
